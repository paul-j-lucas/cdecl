-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes in Cdecl 15.1

** C99 with extension error messages
Improved C99 with extension error messages.

** `GCC_COLORS`
Support for `GCC_COLORS` has been removed. It was more of a hindrance than a
help.

** Implicit `int` pointers in C++
Implicit `int` pointer declarations, e.g., `*p`, are now correctly illegal in
C++.

** `--infer-command`, `-I`
The former `--explain` and `-e` options have been renamed `--infer-command` and
`-I`; the former `explain-by-default` `set` option has been renamed `infer-
command`.

** Lambdas in C
Lambdas are not correctly illegal in C.

** Nested `typedef`s
Fixed printing of `typedef`s of nested types, e.g.:

    c++decl> struct S { typedef int I; }
    c++decl> typedef typename S::I T
    c++decl> show
    typedef S::I T;

** `restrict` arrays
Arrays being `restrict` except as function parameter is now correctly illegal.

** Types in error & warning messages
For types that are `typedef`s, now printing `aka` followed by their underlying
types in more cases.

** Fixed escaped newlines
Fixed escaped newline handling when not using GNU readline.

** Fixed `q` command
Fixed having `q` be a synonym for `quit` in `infer-command` (formerly `explain-
by-default`) mode.


* Changes in Cdecl 15.0

** Coalesced `explain` output
Output from `explain` coalesces same-base-type declarations together, e.g.:

    cdecl> explain int x, *p, y
    declare x, y as integer
    declare p as pointer to integer

** Command help
The `help` command now accepts a **cdecl** command name and prints help for
only that command.

** Optional `unique_id` in dump output
By default, dumped AST JSON5 no longer includes `unique_id` values.  (This is
so diffs of debug output that differ only by `unique_id` don't cause tests to
fail.)

Correspondingly, the `-d` and `--debug` command-line options and the `debug`
`set` option now optionally take a `u` argment to re-enable printing
`unique_id` values (that are useful for debugging).

** `dup_from_id`
When dumping JSON5 output and `unique_id` values are included, an additional
`dup_from_id` value is now also printed. It is the `unique_id` of the AST node
the current node was duplicated from, if any.

** Dump in JSON5 (really)
The format of the dump output is now (really) in valid JSON5 format.

** More std types
Added more standard types.

** Folded `cast` help
Help for new-style casts has been folded into the same line for C-style casts.

** `--no-buffer-stdout` & `-b`
Added command-line options to set stdout to unbuffered.  (This is useful to
print output immediately while single-stepping in a debugger.)

** `non-throwing`
Previously, `non-throwing` always means `throw()`.  Now, the meaning changes
based on the current language: if it's C++11 or later, it means `noexcept`.

** `type` in `define`
**cdecl** now allows the word `type` to appear in a `define` command, e.g.:

    define PI as pointer to int
    define PI as type pointer to int    // same as above

** Multiple declarations fixes
Declarations like:

    explain bool b, operator!(const S&)
    explain int f(), a[2]

now work.

** Showing `inline namespace` types
Showing `inline namespace` types as gibberish has been fixed.

** Types in error & warning messages
The offending type is now included in error messages.  For example:

    cdecl> explain void f(double d, int x[d])
                                         ^
    31: error: invalid array dimention type "double"; must be integral

If the type is a `typedef`, also prints `aka` followed by its underlying type:

    c++decl> explain std::size_t operator new( std::size_t )
                     ^
    9: error: invalid operator "new" return type "std::size_t" (aka, "unsigned long"); must be "void*"


* Changes in Cdecl 14.4

** `_Alignas` forward declarations
`_Alignas` is now correctly forbidden on forward declarations.

** `auto` with multiple declarators in C
`auto` with multiple declarators is now correctly forbidden in C.

** `auto *p` in C
`auto` with a pointer declarator is now correctly forbidden in C.

** Bit-field `typedef`s for `enum`s
A bit-field of a `typedef` for an `enum` is now correctly forbidden in C:

    typedef enum E T
    explain T x : 4                     // error: enum bit-field is illegal

** `const` `typedef` of reference
**cdecl** will now warn about applying `const` to a reference `typedef`:

    c++decl> using rint = int&;
    c++decl> explain const rint x
                     ^
    9: warning: "const" on reference type has no effect

** Reference to function or reference
**cdecl** now correctly allows references to function and references.

** Reworked qualified array syntax
C99 added the ability to qualify function parameters using array syntax, e.g.:

    void f( int x[const] );             // or volatile or restrict
    void f( int x[static 2] );          // must be non-null and 2 mininum size

The problem was if this new use of `static` was converted to pseudo-English in
the intuitive way:

    declare f as function (x as static array 2 of integer) returning void

then it would be ambiguous with conventional `static` arrays:

    static int x[2];

As an ugly fix, **cdecl** forced you to put the qualifiers _after_ `array`:

    declare f as function (x as array static 2 of integer) returning void

The new `static` is really a new qualifier, not a storage-class specifier.  To
give **cdecl** an intuitive syntax, the new `static` is now `non-empty` in
pseudo-English to disambiguate it and allow it to come _before_ `array`:

    declare f as function (x as non-empty array 2 of integer) returning void

** Function returning `typedef` of `volatile`
Functions returning a `typedef` of `volatile` are now correctly warned about in
C++20 and later:

    c++decl> using vint = volatile int
    c++decl> explain vint f()
                     ^
    9: warning: "volatile" return types are deprecated since C++20
    declare f as function returning vint

** Member functions with linkage
Now flagging member functions with user-specified linkage as an error.

** Unsupported `set` options
When printing all `set` options in response to the `set` command, **cdecl** now
also prints `(Not supported ....)` next to options that are not supported in
the current language.


* Changes in Cdecl 14.3

** `*` and `-`
For the `explicit-ecsu`, `explicit-int`, and `west-pointer` options, `*` is a
synonym for "all" and `-` is a synonym for "none" but only when they're by
themselves.

** Arrays with named sizes
Arrays can now have names to denote their size, e.g.:

    cdecl> explain int a[N]
    declare a as array N of integer

When such an array is a function parameter, **cdecl** now knows it's a VLA:

    cdecl> explain void f( int n, int a[n] )
    declare f as function (n as integer, a as variable length array n of integer) returning void

** Autocompleting `precision`
`precision` is now autocompleted following `double` in pseudo-English.

** Autocompleting `returning` for lambdas
`returning` was added to the set of next autocompletable keywords for `lambda`.

** Ding on no command match
When no command is matched at all for autocompletion, we now ring the bell.

** Improved "declaration expected" error message
For declarations like:

    cdecl> explain int float

**cdecl** now mentions that "float" is a keyword in error messages.


* Changes in Cdecl 14.2

** Autocompletion `=`
Autocompleting `set` options that take a value now includes `=`.

** `-I` changed to `-i`
The `-I` option (`--explicit-int`) has been changed to `-i`.

** `-R` changed to `-r`
The `-R` option (`--trailing-return`) has been changed to `-r`.

** "West" pointer types
New `--west-pointer` and `-w` command-line options and a new `west-pointer`
`set` option allow specification of when to print `*`, `&`, and `&&` adjacent
to types ("west"):

    int *p;  // east
    int* p;  // west


* Changes in Cdecl 14.1.1

** Escaping quotes in dump strings
When dumping, quotes in strings are now properly escaped.

** Quoting lambda capture dump strings
When dumping, `this` and `*this` are now properly quoted.

** Fixed operator dump crash
Dumping an operator caused a crash: fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 14.1

** Alternative tokens
Blocks, lambda captures, and reference functions now correctly print
alternative tokens when the option is enabled.

** Alternative tokens vs. di/trigraphs
If both alternative token and either di/trigraph options are set, alternative
tokens now have priority.

** C casting without a name
Now allowing C-style casting without a name:

    cdecl> cast to pointer to char
    (char*)

** Di/Trigraphs
Now correctly emitting di/trigraphs for lambda captures and `operator[]`.

** Debug output
The format of the debug output has been made more JSON5-like.

** Limit when `q` means `quit`
The `q` command is now recognized as a synonym for `quit` only when it's the
only thing on a line other than whitespace.  This now allows things like:

    cdecl> declare p, q as pointer to int
    int *p, *q;

to work without complaining that `q` is a **cdecl** keyword.

** Trailing return type
New `--trailing-return` and `-R` command-line options and `trailing-return`
`set` option enable printing a function's or operator's return type using the
trailing return type syntax in C++11 and later.

** `unsigned` in K&R C
Now correctly restrict `unsigned` to `int` only in K&R C.

** Verbose version
If either the `--version` or `-v` is given twice, additionally prints the set
of `configure` feature & package options and whether GNU readline (if compiled
in) is genuine.

** Fixed explicit constructor with unecessary `()`
A declaration like:

    explain explicit (C)(int)

that's an explicit constructor with unnecessary `()` caused a crash.  Fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 14.0

** Autocompletion bell
When hitting TAB and there are no completion matches, **cdecl** now rings the
terminal's bell.

** Cast into array
Now correctly allowing casting into an array when there is no name:

    cdecl> explain (char const *const[])
    cast into array of constant pointer to constant character

** Destructors in C
**Cdecl** now correctly reports destructors in C as an error.

** Digraph & trigraph fixes
The digraphs and trigraphs for `{` and `}` weren't emitted when they should
have been for nested types.  The digraphs & trigraphs for `{` and `}` weren't
parsed at all.  Both fixed.

** Lambdas
Support for C++ lambdas has been added:

    c++decl> explain [=,&x](int n)
    declare lambda capturing [copy by default, reference to x] (n as integer)

** Undid K&R function parameter printed as `int`
Undid a change in **cdecl** 11.5 where K&R C typeless function parameters were
printed as being of type `int`: they now again print as only their names.


* Changes in Cdecl 13.2

** Improved autocompletion
In cases where words in pseudo-Engish can only have a limited set of words that
follow in the grammar, only those are now suggested.

** Array of array check
Now correctly reporting declarations of arrays of incomplete arrays as an
error, e.g.:

    cdecl> explain void f(int x[][])
                                 ^
    23: error: array dimension required

** Fixed color prompts
Prompts were always being displayed in color even when --color=never.  Fixed.

** Function parameter checks
No longer require certain declarations to be function parameters: `const`,
`volatile`, `static`, and variable length arrays; `[[carries_dependency]]`.
This was changed so you can explain an individual function parameter
declaration without having to wrap it inside a function declaration.

** Autocompletion word-break characters
The set of word-break characters for autocompletion has been expanded to be
(almost) all non-identifier characters.

** `extern void v`
C allows you to declare an object of an incomplete type, so C allows:

    extern void v

Now cdecl does also.

** More English synonyms
The following English synonyms have been added:

    bit-precise integer  _BitInt
    bit precise integer  _BitInt

** `[[no_unique_address]]` bit fields
Bit-fields having `[[no_unique_address]]` are now correctly reported as an
error.

** User-defined literal parameter lists
Fixed requiring parameter list for user-defined literals in English.


* Changes in Cdecl 13.1

** `auto` type definitions and casts
Defining or casting a type containing `auto` is now correctly reported as an
error.

** C23 `auto`
Added support for `auto` as a deduced type in C23.

** C23 trigraphs
Trigraphs are no longer supported in C23.

** `_BitInt(<int>)` help
`_BitInt(<int>)` was added to the help text.

** Color prompt
Now printing the prompt in color even when readline is disabled.

** More English synonyms
The following English synonyms have been added:

                    boolean  _Bool
                    Boolean  _Bool
                     char 8  char8_t
                    char 16  char16_t
                    char 32  char32_t
                 const-eval  consteval
        constant-evaluation  consteval
                 const-expr  constexpr
        constant-expression  constexpr
                 const-init  constinit
    constant-initialization  constinit
           double precision  double
             floating point  float
               user defined  user-defined
             wide character  wchar_t

** C++ `auto` help
`auto` is now correctly listed as a C++ type in the help for C++11 and later.

** More pseudo-English type names
When explaining gibberish, print types in C/C++ (e.g., `int`), not pseudo-
English (e.g., `integer`).

** `--no-english-types`, `-T`, & `english-types`
Added command-line options to disable printing type names in pseuso-English and
corresponding `set` option.

** More english for user-defined conversions
User-defined conversions in pseudo-English now allow "const[ant] eval[uation]",
"const[ant] expr[ession]", and "const[ant] init[ialization]" for a storage
class.

** `_BitInt` maximum bits
Now check that the maximum number of bits for `_BitInt` is 64.

** `explicit-int` parsing
Fixed a bug of not resetting the current `explicit-int` option to none before
parsing a new string.

** `friend` scoped user-defined conversion operators
Explaining a `friend` scoped user-defined conversion operator, e.g.:

    explain friend C::operator int()

is now parsed correctly.

** `[[noreturn]]` in C23.
`[[noreturn]]` is now printed rather than `_Noreturn` in C23.

** Invalid destructor name error
Improved the error message for an invalid destructor name, e.g., `S::~T`.

** Removed `--interactive` & `-i` options
Removed these command-line options.  They've been in cdecl since the beginning,
but never seemed to have a justification.

** `exit` and `quit` command line arguments
Both the `exit` and `quit` commands when given as the first word of the first
argument on the command line are now correctly reported as an error.

** C23 `constexpr` help
Added missing `constexpr` to the help for C23.

** Missing C++ types man page
Added some missing C++23 types to the manual page.

** Octal digit separators
Digit separators are now supported for octal integers.

** `reproducible` and `unsequenced` man page
Added missing `reproducible` and `unsequenced` to the manual page.

** Variadic function parameter
A `...` is now correctly allowed as the only function parameter in C++ as well
as C23.


* Changes in Cdecl 13.0

** Better copy constructor support
Declarations like:

    c++decl> explain C(C const&)
    declare C as constructor (reference to constant C)

are now supported better.

** C23 `alignas`
In C23, `alignas` is now used instead of `_Alignas`.

** C23 `_BitInt(N)`
The `_BitInt(N)` type in C23 in now supported.

** C23 `bool`
In C23, `bool` is now used instead of `_Bool`.

** C23 `constexpr`
The `constexpr` storage class in C23 is now supported.

** C23 fixed type `enum`
Fixed-type enumerations in C23 are now supported.

** Digit separators
Digit separators are now supported.

** C23 `reproducible` & `unsequenced`
These C23 attributes are now supported.

** C23 `thread_local`
In C23, `thread_local` is now used instead of `_Thread_local`.

** C23 `true`, `false`, `nullptr`, `static_assert`, & `thread_local`
These are now also keywords in C23.

** C23 `typeof` & `typeof_unqual`
These C23 keywords are now recognized, but not supported by cdecl.

** More C++23 standard types
Added the standard C++23 types `std::bfloat16_t`, `std::float128_t`,
`std::float16_t`, `std::float32_t`, `std::float64_t`, `std::ospanstream`,
`std::spanbuf`, `std::spanstream`, `std::stacktrace`, `std::unexpect_t`,
`std::wospanstream`, `std::wspanbuf`, and `std::wspanstream`.

** Enumeration bit-fields
Enumerations in C++ can now be bit fields.

** C++23 explicit object parameters
Explicit object parameters in C++23 are preliminarily supported.

** C++ `static` `operator()`
Now allow `operator()` to be `static` in C++23.

** Added `std::bernoulli_distribution` and `std::random_device`
Added these missing C++11 types.

** `static` or `const` array parameters
Both `static` or `const` array declarations are now additionally recognized
outside of function parameters allowing more specific error reporting (since
they're still illegal).

** C++11 explicit user-defined conversion operators
Explicit user-defined conversion operators are now correctly allowed in C++11
and later.

** Echoing commands
A new `--echo-commands`/`-O` command-line option and `echo-commands` set option
has been added that echos command given before corresponding output.  (This is
primarily useful for associating command output with input in test scripts.)

** Better alignment error location
Improved the location of alignment errors.

** Fixed aligned bit fields
Aligned bit fields are now correctly forbidden.

** Fixed `noprompt` error column
Fixed the error column when the prompt is disabled.

** Fixed function returning pointer to member pointer to T
The output of a declaration like:

    c++decl> declare f as function returning pointer to member of class C \
        pointer to int
    int* C::* f();

has been fixed.

** `pointer` auto-completion
`pointer` is now auto-completable.

** Fixed implicit `int` checking error message
A declaration omitting `int` now gives the correct error message:

     cdecl> explain void f(register i)
                           ^
     16: error: implicit "int" is illegal since C99

** Fixed `const` array
Array parameters no longer have a space wrongly emitted after `const`.

** Fixed fixed type `enum` definition
Fixed type `enum` definitions are now printed as C++ correctly.


* Changes in Cdecl 12.0

** Added suggestions
Added suggestions to error messages in certain cases when a keyword is
expected, for example:

    cdecl> declare x as type poiner to int
                             ^
    19: syntax error: "poiner": "as" expected; did you mean "pointer"?

** Better executable name checking
Previously, if cdecl was invoked as `cast`, `declare`, or `explain`, or with a
name that isn't a command (through renaming or a hard or a symbolic link)
without command-line arguments, it behaved as if it were invoked as `cdecl`
without error.  This has been fixed.

** C23
The placeholder name of C2X has been changed to C23.

** Color and `TERM`
The `TERM` environment variable is no longer considered when determining
whether color should be used in output.  Now, all that matters is whether the
output stream is connected to a TTY.

** `exit` auto-completion
The `exit` command is no longer auto-completable enabling `explain` to be auto-
completed after typing only `ex` rather than `exp` as before.

** `help options` types
Help for types was added to options help.

** `explicit` help
The missing `explicit` was added to the help.

** `explicit-escu` for `enum`
The `explicit-ecsu` option for enums is fixed.

** `include`
Added a new `include` command to include cdecl commands from files either from
a configuration file or the cdecl command line.

** `_Noreturn` deprecated
`_Noreturn` is now deprecated in C23.

** Printing of types
Now printing types in error messages as they were originally defined (pseudo-
English vs. gibberish) in more cases.

** Additional sanitizers
The `configure` options of `--enable-msan` and `--enable-ubsan` have been added
to enable clang's Memory Sanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer,
respectively.  The previous `--enable-address-sanitizer` has been renamed to
`--enable-asan`.

** `show` autocompletion
The `show` command now uses command-specific autocompletion.

** Overloading `co_await` operator
Overloading the `co_await` operator is now supported.

** Predefined types
Fixed spelling of `bad_typeid`; added `source_location`, `type_index`, and
`type_info`.

** Types as objects, English edition
Previously declared types in pseudo-Engilsh are now checked to ensure they're
not being used as objects:

    cdecl> struct S
    cdecl> declare S as int             // error (now)


* Changes in Cdecl 11.15

** `_Atomic` arrays
`_Atomic` arrays are now correctly forbidden:

    typedef int A[2]
    explain _Atomic A x  // error: _Atomic array of T is illegal

Note that:

    _Atomic int x[2];    // OK: array of _Atomic T is legal

is legal.

** `CDECLRC` environment variable
If none of the `--config`, `-c`, `--no-config`, nor `-C` command line options
are given and the value of the `CDECLRC` environment variable isn't empty, it's
used as the full path to the cdeclrc file to read upon start-up.

** Configuration file default language
Previously, cdecl would temporarily set the current language to the latest
supported version of C++ while reading a configuration file.  It no longer does
this as a special case.  Now, as always, it sets the default language based on
the executable name.

** `enum` alignment in C11
Alignment of enums is now correctly allowed in C11.

** Types as objects
Previously declared types are now checked to ensure they're not being used as
objects:

    cdecl> struct S
    cdecl> explain int S                // error (now)


* Changes in Cdecl 11.14

** Alternative tokens & digraphs
Now prints a warning that neither alternative tokens nor digraphs are supported
until C95.  Also now printing a warning if alternative tokens are set and the
current language changes to one that doesn't support them.

** `east-const` in K&R C
Now prints a warning that `east-const` isn't supported until C89.

** `using`
Now prints a warning that `using` isn't supported until C++11.

** Fixed `void f(int())`
The long-standing issue <https://github.com/paul-j-lucas/cdecl/issues/10> has
finally been fixed.

** Fixed help message
The old mention of `files...` in the help messages was removed.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.13

** Aligned `enum`, `struct`, and `union` in C
Alignment of `enum`, `struct`, and `union` is now correctly forbidden in C.

** `alignas` & `_Alignas`
These keywords are now additionally allowed instead of `aligned [as|to]` in
pseudo-English.

** Auto-completion of cdecl keywords
Cdecl keywords are now _not_ auto-completable when explaining gibberish.

** Auto-completion tweaks
`new` is now auto-completable; `variadic` is now autocompletable only in C89
and later.  The following are now _not_ autocompletable: `co_await`,
`co_return`, `co_yield`, `concept`, `decltype`, and `requires`.

** `restrict` of `typedef`
`restrict` is now correctly allowed on `typedef`s of pointer:

    cdecl> typdef int *pint
    cdecl> explain restrict pint p
    declare p as restricted pint

** `return` English shorthand
`return` is now accepted as a shorthand for `returning` in pseudo-English.

** English new-style cast synonyms
The C++ keywords `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, and
`static_cast` are now synonyms for their respective two-word counterparts in
pseudo-English.

** Fixed core dump for `--debug`/`-d` for operator
Fixed a core dump when using the `--debug`/`-d` option for an operator.

** Fixed function returning function parameter crash
A crash for:

    explain void f( int()() )

(which is illegal) has been fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.12

** `noexcept` for function parameters
`noexcept` is now correctly allowed for pointers to function parameter
arguments:

    c++decl> explain void g( void (*f)() noexcept )
    declare g as function (f as pointer to no-exception function returning void) returning void

** Dynamic exception specifications
These are now parsed, but either not supported by cdecl through C++14 or no
longer supported in C++17.

** Ignore leading whitespace for command completion
Previously, if there was any leading whitesplace before a command, that is:

    cdecl>  dec<TAB>
           ^
           leading whitespace

it wouldn't match: now it does.

** Fixed interactive column
The column number printed for error and warning messages while interactive is
now correct.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.11

** `using` with attributes
Now supporting `using` with attributes:

    c++decl> explain using Int [[maybe_unused]] = int
    declare Int as maybe unused type int

** Declare types with `using`
In C++11 and later, types are now declared with `using` instead of `typedef` by
default.

** `using` declarations
New `--no-using`/`-u` command-line option and `using` set option that control
whether types are declared with `using` instead of `typedef` in C++11 and
later:

    c++decl> declare pint as type pointer to int
    using pint = int*;
    c++decl> set nousing
    c++decl> declare pint as type pointer to int
    typedef int *pint;

** More K&R C types
The types `caaddr_t` and `daddr_t` were added; `jmp_buf` was moved from C89.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.10

** Pre-C99 implicit `int`
Added more support for pre-C99 implicit `int`:

    explain *p                          // pointer to int
    explain *p, i                       // pointer to int, int
    explain *a[4]                       // array 4 of pointer to int
    explain *f()                        // function returning pointer to int
    explain (*p)                        // pointer to int -- unnecessary ()

** `const void` function parameters
`const` (and `volatile`) qualifiers for `void` as a function "parameter" (even
via a `typedef`) are now correctly flagged as an error:

    void f1(void);                      // OK
    void f2(const void);                // error

    typedef void Void;
    void f3(Void);                      // OK

    typedef const void CVoid;
    void f4(CVoid);                     // error

** Redefinition check in C++
C++ doesn't support tentative definitions, so:

    int i, i;                           // OK in C; error in C++

is always an error in C++ even if the types match.

** Restricted pointer to non-object
A restricted pointer to a non-object, e.g., function, is now correctly flagged
as an error:

    int (*restrict pf)();               // error


* Changes in Cdecl 11.9

** Fixed reading from stdin
Fixed reading from stdin when it's not a TTY.

** Redefinition check
Names being redefined with a different type in the same declaration are now
correctly forbidden:

    int i, i;                           // OK (tentative definition)
    int j, *j;                          // error: different type

** Function-like parameter redefinition check
Function-like parameters are now checked for redefinition (more than one
parameter having the same name).

** More C++23 standard types
Added the standard C++ types `std::ispanstream`, `std::stacktrace_entry`,
and `std::wispanstream`.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.8

** New cdecl keywords
There are now the new pseudo-English keywords of `evaluation` (plus `eval` as a
shorthand), `expression` (plus `expr`), and `initialization` (plus `init`) that
can optionally be used after `constant` (or `const`) instead of `consteval`,
`constexpr`, or `constinit`, respectively:

    c++decl> declare f as constant expression function returning int
    constexpr int f();

There are now the new pseudo-English keywords of `maybe`, `unused`, `thread`,
`local`, as well as `discard`, `except`, and `return` that can be used after
`no` that can be used instead of `maybe_unused`, `thread_local`, `nodiscard`,
`noexcept`, and `noreturn`.

** Fixed reading of stdin
The "no files as arguments" change broke reading of stdin; fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.7

** Cdecl keywords
When an unexpected name token is encountered, if said token is a cdecl keyword,
it's now mentioned in the error message:

    cdecl> declare ptr as pointer to void
                   ^
    16: syntax error: "ptr": name expected ("ptr" is a cdecl keyword)

Additionally, cdecl keywords are now also offered in suggestions.

** `register` arrays
`register` arrays are now correctly allowed.

** Zero-sized arrays
Zero-sized arrays are now correctly forbidden.

** No files as arguments
Command-line arguments were treated as files if they weren't commands.  This
dubious use-case was a hold-over from the original cdecl and has been removed.
(If you want to read a file use -f.)


* Changes in Cdecl 11.6

** C++23 integer literal suffixes
The case-insensitive integer literal suffixes of `uz` and `zu` for `size_t` and
`z` for `ssize_t` are now supported.

** C++23 `operator[]`
Now allowing `operator[]` to have zero or more arguments starting in C++23.

** Fixed bug with array of function
Given:

    cdecl> explain int f[5](double)
    declare f as function (double) returning int

cdecl (1) incorrectly elided the array and therefore (2) didn't report the
array of function as an error.

** `typedef` of function
`typedef`s of function are now correctly allowed:

    typedef int F(void)


* Changes in Cdecl 11.5

** Better error/warning locations
Locations for error and warning messages have been improved.

** `show` error improvement
The `show` command now correctly prints all possible commands to define a type
when requested to show a type that doesn't exist.

** `register` warnings
A deprecated warning is now printed for a `register` array, enum, class,
struct, union, pointer, pointer to member, reference, and rvalue reference
between C++11 and C++14.  (Previously, a warning was printed only for built-in
types and typedefs.)

** K&R function parameter printed as `int`
For functions having K&R C typeless parameters, `int` is now printed in C89 and
later since such parameters are implicitly `int`.

** `show using` before C++11
A `show using` before C++11 now prints an error.

** Help output
Tweaked help output.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.4

** `_Atomic(T)` in C++23
Now supporting the `_Atomic(T)` macro in C++23.

** Fixed pointer to a `typedef` of `void`
Declarations like:

    typedef void V
    explain V *p

are now fixed.

** Allow declarations using unknown scoped type names
Previously, cdecl complained about things like:

    cdecl> define S as struct S
    cdecl> explain S::T x
                      ^
    19: error: "T": unknown name

Now, it just assumes the `T` is a type:

    declare x as T of structure S

** cvr-qualified `_Atomic`
`const`-`volatile`-`restrict`-qualified `_Atomic` types are now correctly
forbidden.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.3

** Added `explicit-ecsu` option
Both a `--explicit-ecsu`/`-S` command-line and `explicit-ecsu` set option have
been added that set which type keywords `enum`, `class`, `struct`, or `union`,
are included explicitly in C++ declarations.  The default is `struct` and
`union` only, so:

    c++decl> declare ps as pointer to struct S
    struct S *ps;
    c++decl> declare pt as pointer to class T
    T *pt;

** Fixed nested array declaration
Explaining a declaration like:

    explain int (a)[4]

is now fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.2

** More C++ cast checks
`const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast` now perform additional
checks.

** Fixed casting to `void`
Fixed the ability to cast to `void`.

** Fixed autocompletion crash
A crash for autocompletion of help options has been fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.1

** Multiple declarations
The `declare` command can now accept multiple names like:

    cdecl> declare p, q as pointer to int
    int *p, *q;

** Digraph & Trigraph output
Digraphs and trigraphs are no longer emitted in a language in which they aren't
supported.

** Help options
The `help` command now also acceptions `options`.  Help for options is now
printed separately.

** Help autocompletion
Help options are now autocompletable.

** Fixed multiple nested declarations crash
Explaining a declaration like:

    explain int (*p), (*q)

is now fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 11.0

** K&R C function returning `struct`
Now correctly forbidding functions returning `struct` in K&R C.

** Digraphs before C95
Either using a digraph or setting the digraphs option in a language before C95
now prints a warning that digraphs are not supported until C95.

** Trigraphs in K&R C
Either using a trigraph or setting the trigraphs option in K&R C now prints a
warning that trigraphs are not supported until C89.

** Optional `()` for `destructor`
Declaring a destructor in English now optionally allows `()`.

** C++23
C++23 is both now allowed for and the default C++ version.  However, there are
as of yet no differences with respect to declarations between it and C++20.

** `inline namespace` command
`inline` is now a command in C++11 and later (presumed to be followed by
`namespace`) and `namespace` is auto-completable.

** Nested `inline` namespaces
C++20's nested inline namespaces are now supported:

    namespace A::inline B { // ...

** `show typedef` & `show using` autocompletion
The keywords `typedef` and `using` are now auto-completable.

** In-class `default`, `delete`, and `noexcept` constructors
These are now accepted.

** `static` `main()` in C
This is now correctly forbidden.

** Fixed C++ raw string literals
A raw string literal like `R"abc(X)ab)abc"` was previously not parsed
correctly.

** Fixed multiple pointers to function having a Microsoft calling convention
Declarations like:

    cdecl> explain int (__stdcall **f)()

are now handled correctly.

** Fixed `typedef` of `void`
`typedef void V` is now correctly allowed and `V p` is now correctly flagged as
an error.

** Fixed pointer to `typedef` of reference
Declarations like:

    typedef int &RI
    explain RI *p

are now correctly flagged as illegal.

** Fixed array of reference
An array of reference (or rvalue reference) is now correctly flagged as an
error.

** Fixed function returning `typedef` of array
Declarations like:

    typedef int A[2]
    explain A f()

are now correctly flagged as illegal.

** Fixed "pointer to function returning pointer to array" function argument
A declaration like `int f(char (*(*)())[])` is now parsed correctly.

** `floating-point`
This is now an English synonym for `float`.

** `double-precision`
This is now an English synonym for `double`.

** Microsoft `__forceinline` declarations
Added support for `__forceinline` (and `_forceinline`), but they're treated as
`inline`.

** Code coverage
Running the test suite can now generate a code coverage report via:

    ./configure --enable-coverage
    make check-coverage

** More types
Added `cc_t`, `DIR`, `fsblkcnt_t`, `fsfilcnt_t`, `id_t`, `pthread_key_t`,
`sig_t`, `sighandler_t`, `siginfo_t`, and `timer_t`.


* Changes in Cdecl 10.4

** Microsoft calling conventions
Added support for Microsoft calling conventions __cdecl, __clrcall, __fastcall,
__stdcall, __thiscall, and __vectorcall.

** Partial support for Microsoft's `__declspec`
Microsoft C's `__declspec` syntax is now parsed, but otherwise ignored.  (A
warning is printed that it's ignored.)

** Microsoft `__asm` declarations
Now recognizing Microsoft's `__asm` just to say it's not supported
(just like `asm`).

** More Microsoft types
Added types `__m128`, `__m128d`, `__m128i`, and `__m64`.

** Updated GnuLib for gcc 11
Pulled a fix from upstream GnuLib to fix a compile error under gcc 11.


* Changes in Cdecl 10.3

** Deleted functions and conversion operators
Marking functions and conversion operators `= delete` is now supported.

** Improved or fixed error messages
Improved or fixed several error messages.


* Changes in Cdecl 10.2

** At most one of `virtual`, `final`, or `override`.
In C++, at most one of `virtual`, `final`, or `override` is now printed.

** Added `typedef` to help
`typedef` has been added to the "store" section of English help.

** Pointers to `union` members
Pointers to `union` members are now allowed.

** `using` forbids type
`using` declarations now correctly forbid names in the types on the right-hand
side:

    using U = void (*F)();              // illegal


* Changes in Cdecl 10.1

** More robust scoped name type checking
Scoped names' scope-types are now checked against previous declarations.  For
example, the second declaration's attempted use of N::C as a namespace is now
flagged as an error because it was previously declared as a class:

    c++decl> namespace N { class C; }
    c++decl> namespace N::C { class D; }
                       ^
    11: error: "N::C" was previously declared as a class:
    > namespace N { class C; }

** More C++ std types
Added types `std::chars_format`, `std::ctype_base::mask`, `std::ios_base`,
`std::ios_base::event`, `std::ios_base::event_callback`,
`std::ios_base::fmtflags`, `std::ios_base::Init`, `std::ios_base::iostate`,
`std::ios_base::openmode`, `std::ios_base::seekdir`, `std::launch`,
`std::regex_constants::match_flag_type`, and
`std::regex_constants::syntax_option_type`.


* Changes in Cdecl 10.0.1

** Fixed flex-debug build
A syntax error in the flex-debug build was fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 10.0

** `asm` declarations
Now recognizing `asm` just to say it's not supported.

** `bootstrap`
Added a `bootstrap` script.

** No lexer & parser error messages
When the lexer prints an error message, the parser no longer does.

** Improved `operator<=>`
Now ensuring return type is one of auto, std::partial_ordering,
std::strong_ordering, or std::weak_ordering; and that all parameters are a
class or reference thereto.

** Default relational operators
Default relational operators in C++20 are now supported.

** C++ raw string literals
C++'s raw string literals `R"delim(...)delim"` are now supported.

** Relaxed `main()` checks
If a function named "main" has any storage-like type that can't be used with
the program's `main()`, assume it's just a member function named "main" and not
the program's `main()`.

** `main()` return type
The return type of the program's `main()` is now correctly restricted to `int`.

** `makedoc.sh`
Added a small script to build the documentation rather than just call Doxygen.
The script prints the location of the document root and the local file URL.  On
macOS, also prints the `open` command to run.

** `register struct`
Declaring a `struct` as `register` is now legal.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.10

** Showing globs
The `show` command now supports globs:

    show foo*         // Show types starting with foo.
    show s::foo*      // Show types starting with foo in top-level scope s.
    show s*::foo      // Show foo types in top-level scopes starting with s.
    show *::foo       // Show foo types in any top-level scope.
    show **::foo      // Show foo types in any scope.

** "Did you mean ...?" for command-line options
"Did you mean ...?" suggestions have been added for command-line long options.

** C78 in help
Added C78 to help text.

** `template` declarations
Now recognizing `template` just to say it's not supported.

** Fixed "null" for unknown name
No longer sometime print "null" when an unknown name is encountered.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.9

** C78
C78 is now accepted as an alias for K&RC.

** "Did you mean ...?" for `set` options
"Did you mean ...?" suggestions have been added for `set` options.

** More predefined types
Added `iconv_t`, `locale_t`, `posix_spawnattr_t`, `posix_spawn_file_actions_t`,
`regex_t`, `regmatch_t`, and `regoff_t`.

** Nested types in C
Nested types:

    struct S { typedef int Int; }

are now correctly caught as an error in C.

** Pointer-to-function qualifiers
A pointer to function with qualifiers, e.g.:

    int (*f)() const                    // illegal

is now correctly caught as an error.

** Scoped name bit-fields
A scoped name having a bit-field width:

    int S::x : 3                        // illegal

is now correctly caught as an error.

** Storage class bit-fields
A declaration having a storage class and a bit-field width:

    static int x : 3                    // illegal

is now correctly caught as an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.8

** Added `extern "C" using` support
`extern "C" using` declarations are now supported.

** C++ `auto` help
The help for pseudo-English now correctly includes `auto` as a storage class
for C++98 and C++03.

** Adding `--explicit-int` to `--help`
Added (the missing) `--explicit-int` to the help message.

** Added `Doxyfile` to tarball
Added (the missing) `Doxyfile` to the dist-generated tarball.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.7

** Multi-type `typedef`
Multiple types can now be declared in a single `typedef`:

    typedef int Int, *Pint;

** New abbreviations
There are new abbreviations:

    conv  conversion
    ctor  constructor
    dtor  destructor

** Qualified pointer spacing
Fixed spacing for qualified pointers.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.6

** Specific languages in error messages
Rather than just say "<feature> is not supported in <current-lang>", now says
"<feature> is not supported until <later-lang>."

** More constructor & destructor warning checks
Constructors and destructors are now checked for `throw`.  Constructor
parameters are now checked for warnings.

** Reserved identifier warnings
Warnings are now given for names that are reserved identifiers, specifically
names that match the patterns `_[A-Z_]*` (C and C++) or `*__*` (C++ only).

** Type redefinition error now includes existing type
If you attempt to redefine an existing type with a different type, the error
message now includes the existing type.

** Fixed `thread_local`
`thread_local` is now correctly allowed only in C11 or C++11 or later.

** Function `auto` parameters in C++20
Functions in C++20 now allow `auto` parameters.

** `_Bool`
`_Bool` is now recognized only in C99 and later and not in C++.

** `imaginary`
`imaginary` is now mapped only to `_Imaginary` in C99 and later and not in C++.

** `throw()` in C++20
`throw()` is no longer supported in C++20.

** Fixed `args` help
The help for `args` no longer prints `<name>` for when the current language is
either C2X or C++.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.5.1

** Functions as parameters
A function as a parameter is now automatically converted to a pointer to
function per 6.3.2.1(4) of the C standard.

** `[[` and `]]` "tokens" allow whitespace
The `[[` and `]]` "tokens" now allow whitespace between them (since they're not
distinct tokens).

** `AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG`
Replaced used of `AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION` with `AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG`.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.5

** Added `enum`, `class`, `struct`, and `union` attribute specifier support
Attributes can now also be specified for `enum`, `class`, `struct`, and `union`
declarations:

    cdecl> explain [[maybe_unused]] struct S x // previously supported
    cdecl> explain struct [[maybe_unused]] S x // now also supported

Unfortunately, the resulting English is the same for both:

    declare x as maybe-unused structure S

because there's no other (obvious) way to word the English so it's different
between cases.

** "Did you mean ...?" for attributes
"Did you mean ...?" suggestions have been added for misspelled attributes.

** Improved "unknown" error messages
When a name is unknown in the current language but exists in a later language,
the type of name is now used in the error message.

** Added fixed-type `enum` support
Fixed-type enumerations are now supported:

    c++decl> explain enum E : char8_t
    define E as enumeration E of type char8_t

** Added `extern "C"` support
`extern "C"` declarations are now supported.

** Added C2X `__attr__` aliases
In C2X, the attribute aliases of `__deprecated__`, `__maybe_unused__`, and
`__nodiscard__` are now supported.

** Added support for parsing C++ attribute arguments
Arguments for attributes are now parsed, but otherwise ignored. (A warning is
printed that it's ignored.)

** Added support for parsing C++17 `using` in attributes
The optional `using` in attributes is now parsed, but otherwise ignored. (A
warning is printed that it's ignored.)

** Added support for parsing GNU `__attribute__`
GNU C's `__attribute__` syntax is now parsed, but otherwise ignored.  (A
warning is printed that it's ignored.)

** Fixed `auto` with storage class
The storage class in a declaration like:

    c++decl> explain static auto f() -> int
    declare f as static function returning int

is now correctly included.

** Fixed `register enum`
Enumerations were wrongly forbidden from being `register`.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.4

** Improved constructor & destructor declaration support
Inline file-scope and defaulted & deleted in-class constructors & destructors
are now supported; `final` & `override` are now supported for destructors.

** Explaining forward declarations
Forward `enum`, `class`, `struct`, and `union` declarations are now supported:

    cdecl> explain struct S
    define S as struct S

** Catching types having bit-field widths
Types having bit-field widths are now correctly reported as errors.

** Fixed showing as `using`
Fixed showing of types having qualified pointers as `using` declarations.

** More predefined types
Added `constraint_handler_t` and `lconv`.

** Fixed `char** f()` crash
Explaining this declaration now works.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.3

** Bit-fields
Declarations with bit-field widths are now supported:

    cdecl> explain unsigned x : 3
    declare x as unsigned int width 3 bits

** Digraph warning
A warning is given if the digraph option is set and the current language is C89
or earlier.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.2

** In-class constructor declarations
In-class constructor declarations without any storage-class-like type are now
supported:

    c++decl> explain C(int)
    declare C as constructor (int)

** Context-senstive `final` & `override`
Both `final` and `override` are now recognized as keywords only in a member
function declaration context:

    c++decl> explain int final
    declare final as int
    c++decl> explain void f() final
    declare f as final virtual member function returning void


* Changes in Cdecl 9.1

** K&R C typedefs
K&R C now has a set of predefined `typedef` declarations distinct from C89 that
include only those shown in the first edition of _The C Programming Language_.

** K&R C `main()` arguments
The arguments of main() are no longer checked for type in K&R C.

** `main()` third argument
A third argument of either:

    char *envp[]
    char **envp

(or `const` versions) for `main()` is now supported.

** K&R C functions
Implicit `int` functions in K&R C are now supported:

    cdecl> set knrc
    cdecl> explain f(x)
    declare f as function (x) returning int

Additionally, if `returning` _english_ is omitted, it's equivalent to
`returning int` in C95 and earlier.

** Language-version-specific help
Help is now specific to particular language versions, not just C or C++.

** `show english`
The `show` command now allows `english` explicitly as an option.  (Since it's
the default, it's ignored.)

** "Did you mean ...?" improvements
"Did you mean ...?" suggestions have been added for `explain` and type
suggestions are only those valid in the current language.

** Additional `no-` English synonyms
The English synonyms of `no-return`, `no-except`, `no-discard`, and `no-unique-
address` have been added.


* Changes in Cdecl 9.0

** Showing as `using` declarations
The `show` command can now alternatively show types as `using` declarations.

** Language-sensitive `show` command
For `predefined` or `user`, the `show` command now shows only types that are
valid in the current language.  (See the man page for details.)

** Language-sensitive type printing
When printing `enum`, `struct`, `class`, or `union` types, they are shown
differently depending on what language the type was defined in and whether the
current language is C or C++:

    c++decl> define S as struct S
    c++decl> show user typedef
    struct S;
    c++decl> set c
    cdecl> show all user typedef
    typedef struct S S;

** co_await, co_return, co_yield added
These C++20 keywords were added to prevent use as identifiers in C++20 and warn
in older languages.


* Changes in Cdecl 8.3

** "Did you mean ...?" added
If you make a typographical error for either commands or type names, you'll now
receive "did you mean?" suggestions as part of the error message.

** Multiple, comma-separated declarations
Multiple, comma-separated declarations are finally supported.

** C17
The official informal name for ISO/IEC 9899:2018 is now C17 instead of C18.
However, C18 is still accepted as an alias for C17.

** C90
C90 is now accepted as an alias for C89.


* Changes in Cdecl 8.2

** Added `align`
Pseudo-English now allows `align` as a synonym for `aligned`.

** Multiple `set` options
The `set` command can now take multiple options.

** Show abbreviated form
When showing types in pseudo-English, the abbreviated form is used, e.g.:

    cdecl> show
    struct S;                           // instead of: typedef struct S S;

** Type-qualified arrays of unspecified size
C99 type-qualified array function arguments can now have a size omitted, e.g.:

    void f( int a[const] );


* Changes in Cdecl 8.1

** Enum declarations
Enumerations can now be declared in the same abbreviated manner as classes:

    enum E
    enum class E2

** Unified Parallel C support
Added support for Unified Parallel C:

+ Added qualifiers "relaxed", "shared", and "strict".
+ However, for the "shared" qualifier, the optional layout qualifier is parsed
  but otherwise ignored.

Since the Unified Parallel C standard is based on C99, support for Unified
Parallel C is available only when the language is set to C99.

** Restricted references
GNU C++ allows references to be restricted:

    void f( int &__restrict r )
    void g( int &&__restrict rr )

Now, cdecl does too.

** More C++ std types
Added types std::adopt_lock_t, std::align_val_t, std::ambiguous_local_time,
std::atomic_bool, std::atomic_char, std::atomic_char16_t, std::atomic_char32_t,
std::atomic_char8_t, std::atomic_flag, std::atomic_int, std::atomic_int16_t,
std::atomic_int32_t, std::atomic_int64_t, std::atomic_int8_t,
std::atomic_int_fast16_t, std::atomic_int_fast32_t, std::atomic_int_fast64_t,
std::atomic_int_fast8_t, std::atomic_int_least16_t, std::atomic_int_least32_t,
std::atomic_int_least64_t, std::atomic_int_least8_t, std::atomic_intmax_t,
std::atomic_intptr_t, std::atomic_llong, std::atomic_long,

** Fixed class declarations
Declaring a class as either:

    class C1
    class C2;

now works.


* Changes in Cdecl 8.0

** C2X support
Added support for C2X:

+ Added type char8_t.
+ Added [[...]] syntax for attributes.
+ Added [[deprecated]], [[maybe_unused]], and [[nodiscard]] attributes.
+ Removed support for typeless function arguments in K&R C.

** More C++20 support
Added support for "constinit" and "export" in C++20.

** Embedded C support
Added support for Embedded C:

+ Added types "_Accum" and "_Fract" (and "accum" and "fract").
+ Added modifier "_Sat" (and "sat" and "saturated").
+ Added the typedefs int_hk_t, int_hr_t, int_k_t, int_lk_t, int_lr_t, int_r_t,
  uint_uhk_t, uint_uhr_t, uint_uk_t, uint_ulk_t, uint_ulr_t, and uint_ur_t.

Since the Embedded C standard is based on C99, support for Embedded C is
available only when the language is set to C99.

** Forbidding attribute syntax
The [[xxx]] attribute syntax is now forbidden until either C2X or C++11.

** class, struct, & union optional ';'
Semicolons are now optional after "class", "struct", or "union" declarations.

** class, struct, & union define themselves
Before now:

    class C { typedef int Int; }

would define only C::Int as a type.  Now, the enclosing class, struct, or union
is also defined as a type.  Hence, the above is now equivalent to:

    define C as class C
    define C::Int as int

This also means that either:

    class C { }
    class C

is eqivalent to:

    define C as class C

** class, struct, & union commands
"class", "struct", and "union" are now commands (just like namespace).

** Per-scope types; fixed English scope name order
Each scope of a scoped name (sname) now has its own type.  Additionally, the
English printed order is now (correctly) inner-to-outermost.  For example:

    c++decl> namespace N { class C { typedef int I; }; }
    c++decl> explain N::C::I x
    declare x as I of class C of namespace N

** Floating-point extensions for C types
Added types _Decimal32_t, _Decimal64_t, _Decimal64x, _Decimal128x, _Float32,
_Float32x, _Float64, _Float128, _Float128x, femode_t, and long_double_t.

** Aligned to
Now allowing "to" in addition to "as" for "... aligned [as|to] ...".

** Show as
Now allowing an optional "as" in "show ... [as] typedef".

** asm
Added "asm" keyword to prevent declarations from using it.


* Changes in Cdecl 7.4.1

** Allowing signed main()
The legal "signed main()" signature is now accepted.

** Ignoring east-const in English
East const is now ignored when explaining gibberish.

** Disallowing reference to reference
References to references are now errors.


* Changes in Cdecl 7.4

** Bison debugging change
Changed --enable--yydebug configure option to --enable-bison-debug,
--yydebug/-y cdecl options to --bison-debug/-B, and yydebug to bison-debug set
option.

** Added Flex debugging
Added --enable-flex-debug configure option, --flex-debug/-F cdecl options, and
flex-debug set option.

** Fixed set options
Finally fixed parsing of set options.


* Changes in Cdecl 7.3

** Checking main()'s signature
The signature of main() is now checked.

** More C standard types
Added the standard C types atomic_flag, double_t, fenv_t, fexcept_t, float_t,
jmp_buf, memory_order, va_list, wctrans_t, and wctype_t.

** Fixed explaining pointer-to-array function arguments
Explaining a declaration like:

    cdecl> explain void f(double (*a)[5])

crashed; fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 7.2

** new & delete operator overloading
Added support for composing and deciphering C++ overloaded new, new[], delete,
and delete[] operators.

** extern & static functions
Extern or static functions can not be const.

** English scoped types
Given:

    struct S { typedef int Int; }
    explain S::Int x

the explanation is:

    declare x as Int of structure S

but English types ("T of ...") weren't legal in cdecl's grammar.  They are now.

** More C++ std types
Added types std::align_val_t, std::destroying_delete_t, and std::nothrow_t.

** throw() put back
"throw" is still a keyword so it was put back in C++20.

** Fixed user-defined literal argument
Explicitly specifying "int" is now accepted.


* Changes in Cdecl 7.1

** Added more GNU extensions
Added GNU C's __complex, __complex__, __const, __inline, __restrict, __signed,
__signed__, __volatile, and __volatile__.

* _Bool in C
In C, _Bool is now emitted rather than bool.

* register removed
register is now removed (but still reserved) in C++17 and later.


* Changes in Cdecl 7.0

** East const
New -E/--east-const command-line and east-const set options to use "east const"
in gibberish:

    cdecl> declare x as const int
    int const x;

** Correct scope names for nested types
Previously, scope names for nested types were always printed as "of scope"; now
they print the type of scope ("class", "struct", "union", or "namespace"):

    c++decl> struct S { typedef int Int; };
    c++decl> explain S::Int x
    declare x as Int of structure S

** Declare const/volatile user-defined conversion operators
Can now declare const/volatile user-defined conversion operators.

** no_unique_address
Added support for the [[no_unique_address]] attribute in C++20.

** Typename
Now allowing "typename" in declarations (even though it's not needed):

    struct S { typedef int I; };
    explain typename S::I x
    typedef typename S::I T

** throw() deprecated/removed
throw() has been deprecated starting with C++11 and removed in C++20.

** Fixed unknown type in typedef
Fixed a crash caused by a case like:

    define S as struct S
    explain S::T x


* Changes in Cdecl 6.11

** Added __inline__, __restrict__, and __thread
Added GNU C's __inline__, __restrict__, and __thread.

** Added GNU C types
The GNU C types _Decimal32, _Decimal64, _Decimal128, _Float128, __float128,
_Float16, __fp16, __ibm128, _Float64x, __float80, and __int128 were added to
the set of predefined types.

** Added Win32 types
All of the Windows types, e.g., DWORD, HANDLE, INT, etc., given here
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types>
were added to the set of predefined types.

** Fixed retypedef
Fixed a crash caused by a case like:

    typedef int I
    typedef I J
    typedef I J


* Changes in Cdecl 6.10

** Added __auto_type
Added GNU C's __auto_type.

** Fixed "long long" C version
The "long long" type was incorrectly allowed in C89; it wasn't added until C99.

** Added pthread.h, threads.h, and C++ thread types
The types pthread_t, pthread_barrier_t, pthread_barrierattr_t, pthread_cond_t,
pthread_condattr_t, pthread_mutex_t, pthread_mutexattr_t, pthread_once_t,
pthread_rwlock_t, pthread_rwlockattr_t, and pthread_spinlock_t from <pthread.h>
(POSIX); the types thrd_t, cnd_t, mtx_t, once_flag, thrd_start_t, tss_dtor_t,
and tss_t from <thread.h> (C11); and std::thread (C++11) and std::jthread
(C++20) from <thread> were added to the set of predefined types.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.9

** Cast accepts "as" and "to"
The "cast" command now accepts "as" and "to" in addition to "into".

** Autocomplete of explain-by-default
Autocomplete was missing explain-by-default; fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.8.2

** Explain-by-default for const and static
When in explain-by-default mode, a special case has to be made for const and
static since explain is implied only when NOT followed by "cast":

    const int *p                        // Implies explain.
    const cast p into pointer to int    // Does NOT imply explain.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.8.1

** Reset lexer start-state
In 6.8, start states were added to the lexer.  Resetting the lexer now includes
also resetting the start state.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.8

** Added set lang=<lang>
Since the set explicit-int option was added (an option that takes a value), a
set lang=<lang> option was added.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.7

** Explicit int in English
Previously when explaining integer declarations, "int" was implicit:

    cdecl> explain unsigned x
    declare x as unsigned

Now "int" is explicit:

    cdecl> explain unsigned x
    declare x as unsigned int

** Added explicit-int option
Both a command-line --explicit-int/-I and explicit-int set option have been
added that set which integer types have "int" explicitly included in
declarations.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.6.2

** Added atomic_char8_t
Added atomic_char8_t typedef for C++20.

** Fixed flex & bison dependency
Now insists on flex & bison only when lexer.c & parser.c don't exist (i.e.,
when building from a git clone that doesn't include those files rather than an
official release that does).

** Explicit structure definition error
Structure declarations (that were never supported) now produce a specific error
message:

    cdecl> explain struct S { int x; };
                            ^
    18: error: structure definitions are not supported

** Fixed libreadline/libcurses dependency
Moved check for libcurses before libreadline since some implementations of the
latter depend on the former (e.g., Solaris 11).

** More gcc warnings
Enabled more gcc warnings and fixed them.

** thread-local
Added this (with a '-') as an English synonym for thread_local (with an '_').


* Changes in Cdecl 6.6.1

** Fixed upgrade install
When installing an upgrade, no longer fails when a c++decl symbolic link
already exists.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.6

** Defaulted & deleted support
Defaulted & deleted special member functions are now supported.

** Explain-by-default option
Both a command-line --explain/-e and explain-by-default set option have been
added that assume a command that doesn't start with any command means "explain."

** Set option abbreviations
Unambiguous set option name abbreviations may now be used.

** Virtual constexpr
Virtual constexpr declarations are now only correctly allowed in C++20.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.5.1

** Complete storage-class-like constructors
Previously, only "explicit" was supported for constructors.  Now all of
constexpr, explicit, friend, inline, and noexcept (or throw()) are supported.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.5

** Much better alternative tokens support
Alternative tokens (and, and_eq, etc.) are now parsed correctly in all cases.
Additionally, alternative tokens can be emitted via the new set alt-tokens
option.

** Changed -q to -p
The --quiet and -q options (that were in the original cdecl) were changed to
--no-prompt and -p so they're more explicit about what they do.

** Trigraphs warning
If the trigraphs option is set and the language is C++17 or later, a warning
will be printed (since trigraphs were removed from C++17).

** Set command output changed
The "set" command now only prints the current options.  Its help has beed added
to the "help" command.

** Better K&R C prototypes error
The error message given when attempting to use function prototypes in K&R C has
been improved.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.4.2

** Fixed 32-bit CPU support
Now (again) supports running on 32-bit platforms.

** More help
The --help option now prints long options and project URLs.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.4.1

** Fixed use of GNU Readline
Several things relating to the use of GNU Readline were fixed.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.4

** Added support for user-defined conversion operators
Now supports C++ user-defined conversion operators.

    cdecl> explain operator int const*() const
    declare constant user-defined conversion operator returning pointer to constant int

** Added support for alignment specifiers
Now supports C11 _Alignas and C++11 alignas specifiers.

    cdecl> explain _Alignas(64) int x
    declare x as int aligned as 16 bytes

** Added more predefined typedefs
More predefined typedefs were added: fd_set, nfds_t, and sigset_t.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.3.2

** Added missing "virtual" for destructor
Added "virtual" that was missing from the help and man page for destructor.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.3.1

** Added support for noexcept constructors
Constructors can now be noexcept.

** Added support for noexcept and virtual destructors
Destructors can now be noexcept and/or virtual.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.3

** Added support for constructors & destructors
Now supports C++ constructors & destructors.

** Split up help command output
The output of the "help" command has been split into "command" and "english"
because the output has gotten too big for an 80x24 screen.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.2

** Added C++11 user-defined literal support
Added support for user-defined literals.  For example:

    cdecl> explain int operator"" _a(unsigned long long x)
    declare _a as user-defined literal (x as unsigned long long) returning int

** More commands as first argument
More commands (define, namespace, set, static, typedef, and using) are now
recognized as such when they are the first argument.

** Added support for char8_t
Now supports C++20's char8_t.

** Added support for more standard types
Added typedef declarations for div_t, imaxdiv_t, ldiv_t, lldiv_t, sig_atomic_t,
streambuf, streamoff, streamsize, and wstreambuf.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.1

** Final or override now implies virtual
Either final or override in a function's signature now implies it's virtual:

    cdecl> explain void f() override
    declare f as overridden virtual member function returning void


* Changes in Cdecl 6.0.2

** Added strndup()
Added Gnulib's strndup() for systems that don't have it.

** Fixed cast warning
Fixed "cast to pointer from integer of different size" on some compilers.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.0.1

** Fixed undefined uint64_t
Fixed a compile-time error on some platforms.


* Changes in Cdecl 6.0

** Added C++ scoped name support
Added support for scoped names in C++.  For example:

    cdecl> explain int S::x
    declare x of scope S as int
    cdecl> define S::T as struct T; explain S::T x
    declare x as T of scope S

** Added partial namespace support
Specifically, you can now perform typedef and using declarations within
namespaces or inline namespaces:

    c++decl> namespace S { inline namespace T { typedef int Int; } }
    c++decl> show user typedef
    namespace S::T { typedef int Int; }


* Changes in Cdecl 5.2

** Added digraph and trigraph support
Added support for digraphs and trigraphs.


* Changes in Cdecl 5.1

** Added C++20 support
Specifically, consteval functions, operator<=>(), and predefined typedefs were
added: partial_ordering, strong_equality, strong_ordering, weak_equality, and
weak_ordering.

** Added C17 support
Since C17 is only a bugfix version, "C17" is merely recognized as a valid
version of C.


* Changes in Cdecl 5.0

** Added all C/C++ keywords
All C/C++ keywords have been added to the lexer/parser to prevent declaring
variables or functions having names that are keywords.  For example:

    declare break as int

is now correctly reported as an error.

Additionally, names that are keywords is later versions of C/C++, while legal,
now issue warnings, e.g.:

    cdecl> declare class as int
                   ^
    18: warning: "class" is a keyword in C++98
    int class;

** Operator overloading
Added support for composing and deciphering C++ overloaded operators:

    c++decl> explain bool operator()() const override
    declare () as overridden virtual constant member operator returning bool

** Fixed const/volatile reference
Declarations of the form:

    declare r as const reference to int
    declare r as volatile reference to int

are now correctly reported as an error.

** Added member/non-member to functions
You can now explcitly specify either "member" or "non-member" in declarations:

    declare f as const member function

Additionally, cdecl will include "member" in function explanations when it can
infer a function is a member function:

    cdecl> explain void f() const
    declare f as constant member function returning void

** Fixed friend const/volatile/override/final/virtual/reference functions
Declarations of the form:

    declare f as friend const function returning bool

are now correctly reported as an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.8.1

** Fixed ^ position
An error in a second (or subsequent) command after a ';', e.g.:

    typedef int Int; show foo

now correctly positions the ^.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.8

** Show command improvement
The show command can now show the definition of a type in English (same as
before, but now the default) or in gibberish as a typedef (new, optional).

Note also that the trailing "types" keyword has been removed from the command:
it wasn't needed.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.7

** Added more predefined types
More predefined typedefs were added: blkcnt_t, blksize_t, clockid_t, clock_t,
dev_t, errno_t, FILE, fpos_t, gid_t, in_addr_t, ino_t, in_port_t, mbstate_t,
mode_t, nlink_t, off_t, pid_t, rlim_t, rsize_t, sa_family_t, socklen_t,
suseconds_t, time_t, uid_t, useconds_t, and wint_t.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.6.1

** Fixed explaining of unnamed array function arguments
Explaining unnamed array function arguments like:

    void f(char[])

now works.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.6

** Explain using declarations
Added support for explaining C++11's "using" declarations.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.5

** Using declarations
Added support for C++11's "using" declarations as a synonym for typedef.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.4.3

** Minor fix to red-black tree code
Now initializing node->parent to NIL.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.4.2

** Fixed declare of function with an invalid argument
A declaration like:

    declare f as function (x as unknown_type)

now correctly reports the unknown type.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.4.1

** Fixed typedef of pointer-to-function
A typedef like:

    typedef void (*f)(int)

now works correctly.

** Added CONFIGURATION FILE section
The cdecl(1) man page now contains a CONFIGURATION FILE section.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.4

** Added C++ attribute specifier support
The C++ attrribute specifiers carries_dependency, deprecated, noreturn,
maybe_unused, and nodiscard are now supported.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.3

** Added C99 _Imaginary number support
C99 _Imaginary number declarations are now supported.

** External
The keyword "external" is now a synonym for "extern".

** More English for explain
More English synonyms are used in explanations, e.g.:

    declare x as automatic
    declare x as constant int
    declare x as enumeration E
    declare x as structure S


* Changes in Cdecl 4.2

** Added noexcept and throw() support
Function declarations may now include exception specifications.

** Fixed handling of leading whitespace in command-line argument
The unusual case of:

    cdecl ' declare x as int'

i.e., a quoted argument having leading whitespace, is now handled correctly.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.1

** New C11 standard atomic types
The following C11 atomic types are now supported via the new typedef command:
atomic_bool, atomic_char, atomic_schar, atomic_char16_t, atomic_char32_t,
atomic_wchar_t, atomic_short, atomic_int, atomic_long, atomic_llong,
atomic_uchar, atomic_ushort, atomic_uint, atomic_ulong, atomic_ullong,
atomic_ptrdiff_t, atomic_size_t, atomic_intmax_t, atomic_intptr_t,
atomic_uintptr_t, atomic_uintmax_t, atomic_int_fast8_t, atomic_int_fast16_t,
atomic_int_fast32_t, atomic_int_fast64_t, atomic_uint_fast8_t,
atomic_uint_fast16_t, atomic_uint_fast32_t, atomic_uint_fast64_t,
atomic_int_least8_t, atomic_int_least16_t, atomic_int_least32_t,
atomic_int_least64_t, atomic_uint_least8_t, atomic_uint_least16_t,
atomic_uint_least32_t, and atomic_uint_least64_t.

** Fixed typedef and define commands with storage classes
Typedef and define now prohibit storage classes, e.g.:

    typedef static int sint;

is now correctly reported as an error.


* Changes in Cdecl 4.0

** Added C++17 support
Specifically, inline variable declarations are now supported.

** New typedef and define commands
New typedef gibberish and define english commands have been added to allow new
types to be defined that can then be used in subsequent declarations and
explanations.

** New C99 standard types
The following C99 types are now supported via the new typedef command:
int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, int_fast8_t, int_fast16_t, int_fast32_t,
int_fast64_t, int_least16_t, int_least32_t, int_least64_t, int_least8_t,

uint_least16_t, uint_least32_t, uint_least64_t, uintmax_t, and uintptr_t.

** New --no-typedefs/-t command-line options
Either of these options suppresses the definition of the standard C99 types.

** Reads configuration file
Upon start-up and if it exists, reads ~/.cdeclrc (by default) for user-defined
typedef or define commands.

** New --config/-c command-line options
These options specify an alternate configuration file to read upon start-up.
As a result, the -c option in earlier versions of cdecl used to specify when to
colorize output has been renamed to -k.

** New --no-config/-C command-line options
These options suppress the reading of a configuration file, even one explicitly
specified via --config/-c.

** New show command
A new show command has been added to show the definition of either predefined
or user-defined types.

** Register warning
The use of "register" now triggers a warning in C++11 and later.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.6

** First word of first argument
The first word of the first non-option command-line argument is now also
checked to see if it's a command thus allowing fully quoted strings:

    $ cdecl 'explain int *const p'


* Changes in Cdecl 3.5

** Added ssize_t
Similar to size_t, support for ssize_t has been added.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.4.1

** Fixed new-style casts C++ version
New-style casts are now permitted as far back as C++98.


* Changes in Cdecl 3.4

** Static & type-qualified arrays
Added support for C99 static and type-qualified array function arguments, e.g.:

    void f( int a[static const 10] );

** Variable length arrays
