 *      T operator OP(U);
 *
 * i.e., having one parameter, are ambiguous (to **cdecl**) between being a

 *        // ...

 *      };
 *
 * then clearly it's a member operator; if it were declared at file scope, then
 * clearly it's a non-member operator; but **cdecl** doesn't have this context.
 *
 * We can tell if an operator is ambiguous if it can take 1 parameter when \ref
 * c_operator::params_min "params_min" is 0 and \ref c_operator::params_max
